# SpringCore
## Project Goal
SpringCore is the foundation for the Springpoint Network's plugin ecosystem. It contains the APIs needed by other plugins to not only function beautifully, but work together. It contains APIs to allow each plugin to demonstrate a sense of unity, as they will all "feel" the same to use, and also provides tools to make the code cleaner on the back. The lead developer is SirFaizdat. This README needs a lot of work, this is just the project goal.
